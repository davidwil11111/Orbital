"""Layer-1 memory: one entry shape, deterministic normalisation, ids, the
injected view, archive contents tables and the id-conservation guard
(spec 124).

The spine of the bounded-memory model. One place that:

  - defines the ONE entry shape every memory file uses (spec 124 §3.1): a
    top-level bullet line that stands on its own, optional indented detail,
    and a daemon-managed ``<!--mem id:… created:… touched:…-->`` comment on
    the line under the bullet. ``## `` headings are sections, not entries;
  - normalises whatever an agent (or a legacy daemon) wrote into that shape
    (``normalise`` — rules N1–N5, lossless and idempotent) at every write
    path and in the tidy pass's deterministic pre-step;
  - stamps ids that are unique across the live file AND its archive, never
    rewriting an existing one (``stamp``);
  - renders the injected view (``inject_view``): every bullet line always,
    indented detail only for the most recently touched / pinned entries, and
    folding by ``## `` section when the bullet lines alone overflow;
  - maintains the file-level pointers: the contents table at the top of
    every ``*_ARCHIVE.md`` and the one-line-per-archive entries in INDEX;
  - guards ids: an entry that leaves a live file must be in its archive or
    it comes back (``conserve_ids`` at the write path, ``restore_missing``
    after a pass) — spec 070's "absence never means removal".

Nothing here archives by age. Archiving is a judgement ("superseded or
finished") and belongs to the Memory session; the daemon only keeps the
shape, the ids and the budget of what is injected.

Token accounting uses ``len(text) / 4`` to match the rest of the codebase
(``token_utils.estimate_message_tokens``, ``context.py``).

    A heading is a legacy entry when it carries a mem-comment (inline, or on
    the line right under it), when its text is numbered (``## 2. Title``),
    or when the first paragraph under it is prose rather than list items.
    A heading whose first paragraph is top-level bullets is a section and
    is left alone. An entry's body runs to the next heading, except that a
    blank line followed by a top-level list item starts a new entry.
